# micro-frontends-website-analyzer

The Micro-Frontends Website Analyzer is a tool designed to evaluate and analyze websites that implement a monolith architecture and suggest ways to convert them into micro-frontends.

Micro-frontend architecture involves breaking down large user interfaces into smaller, more manageable, and independently deployable pieces, enhancing scalability and maintainability.

This project comprises two main repositories:

1. **Backend Repository**: Handles the core analysis logic and data processing.

2. **Frontend Repository**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the analyzer.

The backend software works like a RESTful API. The input parameters for the analysis process can be found in the swagger documentation that is built in the software
http://localhost:5000/api-docs/.
